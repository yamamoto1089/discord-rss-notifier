# Refactoring Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the refactoring of the Discord RSS Notifier codebase to improve maintainability, readability, and testability.

## Changes Made

### Before Refactoring
- **Single large file**: All code in `src/index.ts` (~250 lines)
- **Mixed concerns**: RSS parsing, Discord notifications, caching, and main logic all in one place
- **Hard-coded values**: Magic numbers and inline configurations
- **Limited testability**: Difficult to unit test individual components

### After Refactoring

#### File Structure
```
src/
├── index.ts                    # Main entry point (31 lines)
├── types/
│   └── index.ts               # TypeScript interfaces and types
├── config/
│   └── feeds.ts               # RSS feed configurations
├── services/
│   ├── rssParser.ts           # RSS parsing logic
│   ├── discordNotifier.ts     # Discord webhook notifications
│   └── cacheManager.ts        # Cache file management
└── utils/
    ├── constants.ts           # Application constants
    └── helpers.ts             # Utility functions
```

#### Key Improvements

1. **Separation of Concerns**
   - Each module has a single, well-defined responsibility
   - Services are independent and reusable
   - Configuration is separated from logic

2. **Better Organization**
   - Types centralized in `types/` directory
   - Business logic in `services/` directory
   - Configuration in `config/` directory
   - Utilities in `utils/` directory

3. **Improved Maintainability**
   - Easier to locate and modify specific functionality
   - Changes to one service don't affect others
   - Clear dependency structure

4. **Enhanced Testability**
   - Class-based services can be easily mocked
   - Pure functions can be tested independently
   - Configuration can be easily stubbed for tests

5. **Code Quality**
   - Eliminated magic numbers (1000ms, 2000ms → named constants)
   - Consistent error handling patterns
   - Better TypeScript typing

## Compatibility
- **Fully backward compatible**: All existing functionality preserved
- **Same API**: External interface remains unchanged
- **Same behavior**: RSS parsing and Discord notifications work identically
- **GitHub Actions**: Workflow continues to work without changes

## Benefits
- **Maintainability**: Easier to understand, modify, and extend
- **Testability**: Each component can be tested in isolation
- **Reusability**: Services can be reused in different contexts
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new features or RSS feeds
- **Developer Experience**: Better IDE support and debugging

## Files Modified
- `src/index.ts`: Simplified to main orchestration logic
- **New files created**: 7 new TypeScript modules
- **No breaking changes**: All existing functionality maintained
